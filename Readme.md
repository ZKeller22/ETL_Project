Project Report [ETL Project]

At the end of the week, your team will submit a Final Report that describes the following:
Extract: your original data sources and how the data was formatted (CSV, JSON, pgAdmin 4, etc).
Transform: what data cleaning or transformation was required.
Load: the final database, tables/collections, and why this was chosen.

The code - either in script form or via Jupyter Notebook - that contains your ETL.
Please upload the report to Github with your code and submit a link to Bootcampspot.
